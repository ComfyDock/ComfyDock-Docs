# What is ComfyDock?


ComfyDock is a tool that allows you to easily manage your ComfyUI environments via Docker.

## Common Challenges with ComfyUI

- **Custom Node Installation Issues**: Installing new custom nodes can inadvertently change settings across the whole installation, potentially breaking the environment.
- **Workflow Compatibility**: Workflows are often tested with specific custom nodes and ComfyUI versions. Running these workflows on different setups can lead to errors and frustration.
- **Security Risks**: Installing custom nodes directly on your host machine increases the risk of malicious code execution.

## How ComfyDock Helps

- **Environment Duplication**: Easily duplicate your current environment before installing custom nodes. If something breaks, revert to the original environment effortlessly.
- **Deployment and Sharing**: Workflow developers can commit their environments to a Docker image, which can be shared with others and run on cloud GPUs to ensure compatibility.
- **Enhanced Security**: Containers help to isolate the environment, reducing the risk of malicious code impacting your host machine.
