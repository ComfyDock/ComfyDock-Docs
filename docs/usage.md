## **Manager Layout**

ComfyDock has two main sections:

1. **Settings Panel** (top)
2. **Environments Grid** (below)

2. Configure Defaults:
    - ComfyUI Path
    - Port
    - Runtime
    - Start command
3. Click **Save**.

## **Creating a New Environment**

> **Demo Video**
> <video controls>
> <source src="../assets/createEnv_edit1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
> </video>

1. Click **Create Environment**.
![Create Environment](assets/createEnvironmentDialog.png)
2. Fill out fields:
    - **Name**: Any text (emojis allowed).
    - **Docker Image**: Pick a ComfyUI base image from Docker Hub, an image installed locally, or a custom image url using the dialog.
        - See the [Docker Images](#docker-images) section below for more details.
    - **Path to ComfyUI**: A valid directory on your host machine.
        - This can be any valid path to a directory on your host machine that you have write and read permissions to:
        - e.g. “C:\Users\akatz\my\path\to\ComfyUI”
        - If you don’t have ComfyUI already installed at the provided location, you will be prompted to install it after hitting “create”
        - If you provide a path to a directory containing multiple “ComfyUI” folders, the code will select the first directory to use with the environment.
3. Select an **Environment Type** (Default, etc.).
![Environment Type](assets/envTypesLatest.png)
    - If default is selected, the environment will attempt to “mount” the models, output, and input directories from your existing ComfyUI installation into the environment.
    - Mounted directories can be read and written to by the environment, anything not mounted from the host machine will not be accessible by the environment.
    - You can see how changing the Environment Type directly affects the Mount Config by expanding the Advanced Settings tab.
4. Click **Create**.
> **Note**: If you have not yet downloaded the selected ComfyUI release image, then you will be prompted to download it on create.

## **Docker Images**

### **Browsing Docker Hub Images**

![Docker Select Dockerhub](assets/dockerSelectBrowse.png)

When you first open the Docker Image dialog, you will be presented with a list of image tags available on Docker Hub. These images are custom ComfyUI base images that I have created for this tool. You can see the dockerfile and workflow used to build these images [here](https://github.com/ComfyDock/ComfyDock-Docker). See the list of available images on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/akatzai/comfydock-env/general).
The tag format is as follows:
```
<comfyui-release>-py<python-version>-cu<cuda-version>-pt<pytorch-version>
```
You can choose options in the separate dropdowns to filter the images by ComfyUI release, Python version, and CUDA version. You can also search for a specific image by name.
Images that you have already downloaded will be shown in the list with a green "Installed" badge.

> **Note**: If you have not yet downloaded the selected image, then you will be prompted to download it on create.

### **Using Local Images**

![Docker Select Installed](assets/dockerSelectInstalled.png)

If you have a local image already downloaded, you can select it by tag in the “Installed” tab. This list will show all images you currently have available on your machine.

### **Using Custom Images**

![Docker Select Custom](assets/dockerSelectCustom.png)

If you have a custom image you want to use, you can specify it by tag in the “Custom" tab. This input expects a full Docker Hub image tag string:<br/>
e.g. `akatzai/comfydock-env:v2.6.0-py3.12-cu12.1-ptstable`.

> **Note**: Currently only custom images from Docker Hub are supported.

## **Mount Config**

The Mount Config panel now provides granular control over how host directories interact with container paths, with four configurable columns per row:

![Mount Config Screenshot](assets/mountConfigUpdated.png)

### **Columns Explained**

1. **Override (Checkbox):**
    - **Checked:** Manually specify the exact host path. Useful for non-standard directory locations.
    - **Unchecked:** Automatically generates host path by combining your ComfyUI path with the selected container directory name (e.g., if ComfyUI path is `C:\ComfyUI` and container path is `models`, host path becomes `C:\ComfyUI\models`).
2. **Host Path:**
    - The physical directory on your machine that will be connected to the container.
    - Editable directly when Override is checked.
    - Grayed out and auto-generated when Override is unchecked.
3. **Container Path (Dropdown):**
    - Predefined container locations you can map to:
        - `/app/ComfyUI/models`
        - `/app/ComfyUI/output`
        - `/app/ComfyUI/input`
        - `/app/ComfyUI/custom_nodes`
        - `/app/ComfyUI/user`
4. **Mount Action:**
    - **Mount:** Creates live sync between host and container directories (changes reflect immediately in both)
    - **Copy:** Creates a one-time snapshot copy from host to container at environment creation

### **Key Behaviors**

- Changing any Mount Config setting automatically switches Environment Type to "Custom"
- Add new mappings with **Add Directory** button
- Delete mappings using the ❌ icon on each row
- Container paths must be absolute paths starting with `/`
- Host paths follow OS conventions (Windows: `C:\path`, Linux/macOS: `/path`)

### **Mounting vs. Copying (Updated)**

**When to Use Mount:**

- Frequently updated resources (models, input/output folders)
- Shared assets between environments
- Development/testing scenarios needing real-time changes

**When to Use Copy:**

- Creating immutable snapshots for reproducibility
- Archiving specific workflow versions
- Sharing environments with bundled dependencies
- Sensitive data that shouldn't persist in host directories

### **Important Notes:**

- Copied directories become container-only - changes in host won't affect them
- Mounted custom_nodes directories trigger automatic dependency installation
- Read-only mounts (available via advanced settings) prevent accidental container modifications

## **Advanced Options**

![Advanced Options Screenshot](assets/advancedOptions.png)

- **Runtime**: `NVIDIA` for GPU or `None` for CPU.
- **Command**: Extra flags for the ComfyUI startup command, e.g. `--fast` or `--lowvram`.
- **Port**: The web UI port.
